                Hi, I am Juliana and I am currently an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College in Ottawa,
                <abbr>CA</abbr>. I am 23 and I have a degree in Design from Los Andes University in Colombia from which
                I graduated in 2021. I have a passion for art, design and visual graphics but I have recently discovered
                a huge interest in web development. Growing up, I always learned through visual aids and today I am glad
                to be able to communicate with others through graphic design.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> a freelance designer; creating both print and digital designs for different
                companies with opposing visual styles. I can say I am very versatile when it comes to adapting to
                contrasting branding styles, which is an advantage in today's fast paced industry. I also have 2 years
                of experience as a graphic designer in an advertising company. This is where I learned teamwork and
                efficiency to be able to deliver several creative designs every day.
